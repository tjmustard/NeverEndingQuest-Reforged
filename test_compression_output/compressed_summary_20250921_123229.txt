In the late morning of Springmonth 28, 1492, the party found themselves within the oppressive confines of the Shrine of Black Ember, a chamber steeped in dark magic and the remnants of a curse. As they entered, Eirik called out into the silence, only to be met with the unsettling rustle of ash and the flickering shadows that danced behind the blackened altar. The air was thick with the acrid scent of burnt resin and brine, and a spectral figure, Eliad, emerged from the gloom, offering a solemn greeting. He warned the party of the Black Ember Wraith, a malevolent force bound to the shrine, and presented them with a choice: seek knowledge or test the ember's wrath.

Eirik, determined to break the curse, expressed his readiness to confront the wraith. Eliad revealed that the chaplain's journal, which Eirik possessed, contained crucial information about the shadow relic and the means to bind or break the ember's curse. Kira, Thane, and Elen stood by, their trust in Eirik evident as they prepared for the impending confrontation.

With resolve, Eirik approached the altar and offered the chaplain's journal to the flames. As the journal was consumed, visions of the priests' struggles against the shadow relic filled the air, and Eliad imparted the knowledge needed to perform a ritual to bind the ember's wrath. However, the Black Ember Wraith, sensing the shift in power, began to stir restlessly.

After a brief interlude where Eirik's companions welcomed him back into the fold, he decided to taunt the wraith before proceeding with the ritual. Eirik lit the black ritual candles, recited the incantation, and performed the binding gesture with the ritual dagger. His successful natural 20 on the Religion check allowed him to channel the ritual's power effectively, and with a final binding phrase, the wraith was drawn into the heart of the Black Ember crystal, its fury extinguished. The oppressive atmosphere lifted, replaced by a gentle golden glow emanating from the now-purified altar.

Eliad commended the party for their success, indicating that the path to the Briny Gate was now open. The treasures of the altar—Black Ember Crystal, Charred Votive Candles, and a Scroll of Protection from Undead—were now free from corruption, and the party's inventory reflected the consumption of the ritual components.

As they regrouped, Kira, Thane, and Elen expressed their admiration for Eirik's leadership and skill. The party reflected on their journey thus far, with their deeds meticulously recorded in the plot points: the ritual at the Shrine of Black Ember was completed, banishing the wraith and opening the way to deeper catacombs.

With the next steps ahead, the party contemplated their options: to explore the Echoing Tides Gallery, investigate the Drowned Alchemist's Vault, or prepare for the challenges that lay ahead in securing the Drowned King's relic, which was essential to fully breaking the curse. The atmosphere remained charged with anticipation, as the party stood ready to face whatever trials awaited them in the depths of the catacombs.
